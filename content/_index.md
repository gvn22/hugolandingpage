I am a research fellow at the School of Mathematics, University of Leeds. My work centres on computational simulation of complex physical systems with a focus on turbulent fluid flow phenomena.

[My current research](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/maths/staff/5840/girish-nivarti) advances a Direct Statistical Simulation framework for predicting zonal jets in planetary atmospheres with close collaborators at the Department of Physics at Brown University and the Department of Applied Mechanics and Theoretical Physics in Cambridge.

[My PhD research](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/270335) at the University of Cambridge addressed a theoretical problem in turbulent combustion with applications to power gas turbines and Type Ia supernovae. I hold a masters degree from UBC, Vancouver and a bachelors degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur.

<!-- I develop mathematical models and softwares that enable such simulations. I also analyse simulation data to decipher the mechanisms relevant to the physics of the problem at hand. -->

<!-- By nature, this work lies at the intersection of mathematics, physics and software engineering. -->

In 2020, I founded the [Early Career Researcher Fluids Forum](https://fluids.leeds.ac.uk/lifd-sub-groups/early-career-researcher-forum/) as part of the Leeds Institute for Fluid Dynamics.
