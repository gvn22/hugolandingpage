My work involves computational simulation of complex physical systems, with a focus on non-linear fluid flow phenomena.

I develop the underlying mathematical models and softwares that enable such simulations, and I also analyse simulation data that are aimed at addressing specific physical problems.

Currently, I am [building a statistical simulation technique](https://github.com/gvn22/ZonalFlow.jl) with applications to flow transport in planetary atmospheres and nuclear fusion reactors. Previously, I [investigated theoretical problems in turbulent combustion](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/270335) with applications to flame propagation in power gas turbines and Type Ia supernovae.

I served as the founding representative for the [Early Career Researcher Forum](https://fluids.leeds.ac.uk/lifd-sub-groups/early-career-researcher-forum/) for fluid dynamics at the University of Leeds.
