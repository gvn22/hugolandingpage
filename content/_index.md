I work at the [School of Mathematics, University of Leeds](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/maths/staff/5840/girish-nivarti). My work involves computational simulation of complex physical systems, with a focus on fluid flow phenomena.

I develop mathematical models and softwares that enable simulations, and I also analyse simulation data to decipher the mechanisms relevant to the physics of the problem at hand.

<!-- By nature, this work lies at the intersection of mathematics, physics and software engineering. -->

Currently, I am building a [Direct Statistical Simulation framework](https://github.com/gvn22/ZonalFlow.jl) aimed at predicting zonal mean flows in planetary atmospheres.

<!-- My PhD thesis investigated a [theoretical problem in turbulent combustion](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/270335) with applications to flame speeds in power gas turbines and Type Ia supernovae. -->

As part of the Leeds Institute for Fluid Dynamics, I founded the [Fluids Forum](https://fluids.leeds.ac.uk/lifd-sub-groups/early-career-researcher-forum/) for early career researchers in fluids at Leeds.
